## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is a time management technique that involves assigning fixed units of time to an activity or task in advance and then completing that activity or task during the designated time frame.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

The first strategy I will implement is 'eating the frog' by selecting the most difficult task and tackling it first.  The next strategy I will  implement is to 'practice and adapt' by utilizing timers to hold myself to my timeboxes.  Lastly, I will implement 'strategic quitting' to be sure that I  am using my time to be sure I am handling priority issues.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

During Hackathon, had I used timers,  I may have gotten stuck on fewer issues for longer and been able to  accomplish more perhaps.
