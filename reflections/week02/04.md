## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Benefits to planning before writing code are knowing what context you are coding, if manipulating existing code knowing the current code is efficient and correct before updating anything, and it allows for responsive programming.  Plan generally, do not attempt to plan perfectly because things will always change.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When you are stuck, researching the issue on Google is good start.  Chnaces are that someone else has had the same issue and have found a solution as well.  The exact solution may not be exactly what you need, but it can get you started on the correct one.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

My biggest takeaways are that as a beginner in programming I need to  keep my mind open to any and all reviews and other input from those who are more experieinced and take them as learning opportunities as opposed to criticisms.  This is something that I stuggle with and understand I need to not compare myself to others.
