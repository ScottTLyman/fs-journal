## Questions

The tab that allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS is the Elements tab.  This tab is helpful in debugging HTML because it allows you to view each element in detail including classes and IDs

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

A better way to debug your code is to utilize breakpoints or by adding the command word 'debugger' inside your code so that it will run line  by line and assist in pinpointing where errors are occurring.
