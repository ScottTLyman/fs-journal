## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

The threeways to syntactically write functions are function declaration, function expression and arrow function expression.  Declarations are hoisted and therefore can be used before they are defined.  Expressions are not hoisted and must be defined before they can be utilized.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are the names when defining a function. Arguments are values passed to a function when it is invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Higher order functions are functions that pass another function as an argument or a function that returns another function.
