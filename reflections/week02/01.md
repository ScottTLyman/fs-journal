## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope refers to where a variable is available for use, i.e., globally or function/locally. example: A var declared inside a function will only retain its definition inside the function where it was declared.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a mecahism within JavaScript where variables and function declarations are moved to start of scope before execution.  

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Use var if you will re-declare the same variable later.  Let is  for variables that may be updated later but do not require re-declaration.  var can also be updated.  Const for all variables that will remain constant throughout the program and cannot be re-declared or updated.
