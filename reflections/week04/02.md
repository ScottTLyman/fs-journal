## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Three states of a promise are pending, resolved, and rejected.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises seek to resolve issues of callback hell by using chaining.  This mean we use a promise, to which we attach a callback rather than passing it.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The difference between .then() and .catch() is .then() is used for resolved promises and .catch() is used for rejected promises.
