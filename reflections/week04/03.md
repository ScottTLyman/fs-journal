## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

Async/Await make the code look like itâ€™s synchronous, but itâ€™s asynchronous and non-blocking behind the scenes

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

You have to prepend the keyword async to any function and that will make the function return a promise. 

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

Some benefits of Async/Await are that it makes code simpler to read, multiple async functions can run in series, and it makes debugging easier because to the compiler, it is synchronous code.
