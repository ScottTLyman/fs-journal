## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is an encoding schema used for representing binary data in a text format. This is useful when the storage or delivery medium does not support binary data such as when embedding an image into a database, CSS files or HTML. 

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Drawbacks include increased file size, CPU overhead, caching issues and hurting SEO/User experience.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

In the past, web browsers had a limit on how many connections a server could handle, so a site with many images would take a long time for all images to load. Base64 was developed to combat issue, but now we have better technology to handle images and renders Base64 obsolete.
