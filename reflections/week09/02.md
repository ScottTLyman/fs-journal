## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

A Github action is a text file or files created in a repo and are known as workflows.  Workflows can handle common build tasks, like continuous delivery and continuous integration. That means that you can use an action to compress images, test your code, and push the site to your hosting platform when the master branch changes.  You can also use them to control what happens if someone interats with your repo.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

You control what happens when someone interacts with your file. You receive notes when somebody comments or makes a pull request, you can also do an action when someone stars your project.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

The trigger actions available are Workflow, Scheduled,  Webhooks and External.  These workflow events manage the triggering of the actions. Something like a push, a pull request, or a fork that refers to changes in the repository.
