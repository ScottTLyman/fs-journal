## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We utilized Vue3 for the front end, node.js and MongoDB for the back end, html and css for layout and styling.  UML diagram and Figma mockups for basic layout formats as well.

2. What went well so far?

In my opinion, the majority of our project was very straightforward.  Our functionality came across without much difficulty and we were able to agree on color scheme and basic layouts very easily together.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

We did not utilize scrum to the best of its ability and there were many times that wheels seemed to be spinning or functionality that was maybe extraneous was added to the applicaiton.  In addition, there were a few feature stacks that we originally planned to have that were let go but may have expanded our app nicely.  I think better planning throughout rather than just at the beginning is incredibly important.
