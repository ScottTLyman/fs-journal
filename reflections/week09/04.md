## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

SSL certificates are a small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remain private.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

Extended Validation (SV) SSL are the most expensive SSLs to obtain, but they are valuable in showing the legitimacy of your domain from the address bar.  An EV SSL certificate can be obtained by any business, and it should be a priority especially for those that need identity assurance. For instance, if your website processes web payments or collects data, you‚Äôd want to get this certificate.

Organization Validated (OV) SSL certificates offer a medium level of encryption and are obtained in two steps. First, the CA would verify who owns the domain and if the organization is operating legally.  This certificate verifies that your organization and domain validation are real.

The Domain Validation (DV) certificate offers a low level of encryption shown as a green padlock next to the URL in the address bar. This is the quickest validation you can receive, and you‚Äôll only need a few company documents to apply.

Wildcard SSL Certificates are in the ‚Äúdomain and subdomain number‚Äù category. Wildcard SSLs ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use that same certificate for subdomains.

Also known as Multi-domain SSL certificates, Unified Communications certificates (UCCs) allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. UCCs were created to bridge communication between a single server and browser but have since expanded to include multiple domain names by the same owner.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

While the primary purpose of SSL is securing information between the visitor and your website, there are benefits for SEO as well.  For example, SSL is part of Google‚Äôs search ranking algorithm.
