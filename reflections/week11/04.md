## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This has been one of the most difficult things I have ever done in my  life.  And I  am supremely happy with what I have accomplished the last 12 weeks.  This has been  absolutley crazy to me.  I have learned a ton of things that I never expected,and I have  met a bunch of awesome people who  i will know the rest of my  life.  CodeWorks has been an amazing experience and I am glad that I did it.  The only thing that I would change is trying to  do something so stressful while doing something equally if not more stressful outside of the program at the same time.  It affected my timeboxing dramatically and I believe that was  my biggest struggle during my cohort.  As far as my final, I have spent maybe 15 hours this weekend after what I spent in class on Friday and I feel confident that I will pass this final with flying colors.
