## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows the developer to describe a relationship between two classes. One of the classes is called a derived class, and the other we call a base class.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Not all members of a class are inherited. Constructors, for instance, are not and have never been inheritable in CSharp. Child classes also donâ€™t inherit finalizers from their parents.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

While all other members of a base class are inherited by derived classes, whether they are visible or not depends on their accessibility. Private members arenâ€™t visible from child classes. Protected members are visible *only *in child classes, which means theyâ€™re supposed to be used in inheritance. Finally, inherited public members are not only accessible, theyâ€™re part of the public interface of the child class.
