## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

SQL injection is a type of attack that can give an adversary complete control over your web application database by inserting arbitrary SQL code into a database query. There are several types of SQL injection, but they all involve an attacker inserting arbitrary SQL into a web application database query.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

SQL injections typically fall under three categories: In-band SQLi (Classic), Inferential SQLi (Blind) and Out-of-band SQLi. You can classify SQL injections types based on the methods they use to access backend data and their damage potential.

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

Intrusion detection systems (IDS), both network- and host-based, can be tuned to detect SQL injection attacks. Network-based IDSes can monitor all connections to your database server, and flag suspicious activity. A host-based IDS can monitor web server logs and alert when something strange happens.
