## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

Primary keys are pieces of unique information that are used to identify records on a table.  Foreign keys are used to reference data on another table. Itâ€™s how we tell other tables where to look if they want to pull up a specific record.

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias is declared following the first instance of the written table name and can be used in place of writting out the full table name. Using appropriately abbreviated aliases allows our code to be more condensed and even dry while still preserving readability.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsSeen (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT
  ds.*,
  p.*,
  d.*
FROM doctorsSeen ds
JOIN patients p ON ds.patientId = p.id
JOIN doctors d ON ds.doctorId = d.id
WHERE ds.doctorId = @doctorId;
```
