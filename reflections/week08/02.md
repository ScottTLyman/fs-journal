## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication in a small team is important because with fewer people working on a given project, each person has more responsibilities than a larger team.  There is less time for discussion as morework  is needed from each team member.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Adjustments that are needed for agile methodology to  be effective in small teams are clear understanding and optimization of communication within the team as well as accepting the trade-offs and team buy-in while working toward the common goal.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unattainable triangle is a system  of trade-offs between speedof development and quality of delivered software.  The three sides are GOOD,FAST, CHEAP. Software that is good AND fast won't be cheap, good AND cheap won't be fast, and cheap AND fast won't be good software.
