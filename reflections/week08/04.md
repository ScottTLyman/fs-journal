## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing allows testing of individual units of code in isolation.  Component testing allows reliable testing of all Vue functionalities.  End-to-end (E2E) testing validates all layers of an application.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I believe E2E is the best method because It allows the full user experience,manipluating all  aspects of the app to confirm that it operates as expected.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I feel unit testing is the least helpful.  Especially with Vue, it seems labor intensive to unit test code where Vue has so many moving pieces in the background.
