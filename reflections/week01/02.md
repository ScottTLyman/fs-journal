## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A Pseudo-class is a selector keyword that applies a special state to a selected element.  Most common ones I may use would be :root and perhaps :blank or :empty

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity refers to which selector will apply its style when there is more than one selector pointing to a single element.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

I may have to use anotherr !important declaration to override another class in the stylesheet which could affect my later code as well.  By all accounts, it is best to avoid this feature.
