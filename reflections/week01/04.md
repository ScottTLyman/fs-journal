## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wireframing is used to structure the basic layout of a website or app. It assists with the design by keeping it user-focused, clarifying and defining elements and features for the project, and they are quick and cheap to create.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low-fidelity wireframes give a basic idea of layout without attention to scale, showing block shapes and mock content.

Mid-fidelity wireframes are grayscale representations that feature more accurate representations of the layout and features are differentiated from each other. Placeholder texts and images are used here. 

High-fidelity wireframes are highly detailed and give pixel-defined layouts.  They will  usually include actual images and relevant written content allowing for testing of menus and navigation.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I believe that wireframes can alleviatesome of the time taken in design and creation of apps and websites.  From personal experience, sometimes even the wireframe is not enough if  you  find yourself having to redesign on the fly.

Wireframing helps to decide the numberof components you  expect to need, but will not always necessarily be enough once you get going.  And when you start adding in new rows/cols and nesting rows within cols, it begins to get dicey.
