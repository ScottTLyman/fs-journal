## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

The purpose of encapsulation is to keep implementation details hidden from public access and only accessible thorough an interface, not directly.  

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix were breaking changes, leaked implementation details, expanded attack surface for hackers, and self documenting code

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

We create private variables by utilizing closures to create privileged methods.  We do this to give those methods reference-based access to a containing functions variables even after the containing function has returned.
