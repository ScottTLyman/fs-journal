> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The Observer Pattern seeks to solve problems such as keeping a bunch of elements synced with the same data by enabling one-to-many data binding between elements.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three mechanics of the observer pattern are subscribe, unsuscribe, and broadcast.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

I still do not fully understand how the template manages and updates the dom.  I do know that it has to do with the ProxyState and controllers are the only modules that interact with the dom.
