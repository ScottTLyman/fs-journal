## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

The two common operations we will set in the handler are 'get' and 'set'.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

You have to make sure that every Get has a Trap attached to it.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Some of the benefits of using the proxy object in our structure is by keeping those data that we do not want public access allowed or changes to be made private, allowing manipulation via proxy only and never directly.  This maintains integrity of the data and, if necessary, makes later changes to code easier to implement.
