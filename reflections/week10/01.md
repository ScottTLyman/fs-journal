## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

The three categories are Value  type, Reference type and Pointer type.  Value types hold a data value in its memory.  Reference types store the address of where the value is being stored.  Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

the Value-type data types are:
bool
byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint
ulong
ushort

I am unsure of the differences from JavaScript, these types look very similar to those of JS with a few additional types.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types are stored in memory by logging the address of the actual value rather than holding the value itself.
