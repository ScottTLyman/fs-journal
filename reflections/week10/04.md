## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values.  For example, working with variable values called Up, Down, Left, and Right over integers 0, 1, 2,and 3 mapped to those values

2. How can you modify an Enum?

 By default, the underlying type of an enum is int. This default may be changed by specifying a base when declaring the enum.  Another modification you can make to an enum is to set the value of an enum member.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

Icould have used an Enum in my Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock assigning the strings "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", and "spock" instead of the values 1-5 which is what I used initially.
