# Sprint Retrospective

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We utilized pair programming,  switching off driver/navigator every so often.  We considered UX,but to a low degree. Focus was on function over fashion.

2. What went well this week?

I felt like the back end went very well,  the Postman tests were really neat to  have while  writing server side.  Client side looked fair,  could do with a good bit of styling (something I plan to  come back todefinitely.  This was one of my most enjoyed projects thus far)

3. What would you do differently?

I would Google more often, shorten my timeboxes where it pertains to roadblocks, and ask for help much sooner so that I can get a better understanding of where I was and where I needed  to be in my code.  I also still struggle with pseudocode, trying to change from English to machine language, and have a desire to create some kind of  a "dictionary" of  sorts for this.
